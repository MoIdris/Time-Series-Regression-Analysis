- Create the project environment (Repository, virtual environment, file structure)
1. Business Understanding
    - Problem Statement
    - Goal and Objectives
    - Problem Statement
    - Stakeholders
    - Key Metrics and Success Criteria
    - Hypothesis
    - Analytical Questions
    - More Information about the project if applicable
2. Data Understanding
    - Importation of relevant packages
    - Load the data set for the project
    - Perform EDA
        - Data Validity and cleaning
            - Check quick stats about the data (info, head, size, unique values etc ... )
            - Reset date feature to datetime and set as index
            - Check for the completness of the datesets to make sure you are not missing a date(could be week,
            - Create new datapoints for the missing days if any
            - Interpolate or fill NaN values in accordance with business rules and assumptiions for the missin
        - Univariate Analysis (Boxplot, Density plots, calculate skewness, violin plots etc)
        - Bivariate Analysis (Correlation, calplot, lineplot)
            - Decomposition
            - Check for stationarity
            - Create new features for the dataset and analyse relationships
        - Multivariate Analysis(Might be too computationally intensive - skip if this is the case)
    - Answer Analytical Questions with visualizations
    - Hypothesis Testing
3. Data Preparation
    - Split data into train and test datasets appropriately (Do not use model_selection's train_test_split)
    - Create machine learning pipelines
        - Add imputation if any
        - Perform encoding where necessary
4. Modelling
    - Statistical Modelling - (ARIMA, SARIMA, FB Prophet, Auto Regression, etc)
    - Machine Learning Modelling (XGBoost, LinearRegression, etc)
5. Evaluation
